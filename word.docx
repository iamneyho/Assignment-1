 Title: Women's Empowerment and Gender Parity Analysis Project

 

Introduction:  
This project utilizes global Women's Empowerment Index (WEI) data to predict the empowerment group of a country based on indicators like WEI, GGPI, and Sustainable Development Goal regions.

Dataset:  
The dataset was sourced from [Women’s Empowerment Index](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamneyho/Assignment-1/refs/heads/main/women_empowerment_index.csv) and includes features such as WEI, Gender Parity, and Human Development Group. Categorical variables were label-encoded, and numerical values were standardized.

Models:  
Six models were evaluated:
1. Logistic Regression (LR)
2. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
4. Decision Tree Classifier (CART)
5. Naive Bayes (NB)
6. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Methodology:  
The data was split into features and target variable (Women’s Empowerment Group) and then into training and validation sets. K-fold cross-validation (K=10) provided accuracy metrics.

Results:  
Here are the cross-validation accuracy scores:

| Model |Mean Accuracy |Standard Deviation |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| LR    | 87.89%       | 7.80%             |
| LDA   | 80.33%       | 14.47%            |
| KNN   | 84.78%       | 10.84%            |
| CART  | 94.44%       | 10.24%            |
| NB    | 90.11%       | 9.22%             |
| SVM   | 89.00%       | 9.94%             |

The Decision Tree Classifier (CART) performed best with an accuracy of 94.44%.

Visualization:  
The following boxplot compares model performance, showing that CART has the highest accuracy and consistency.

Conclusion:  
CART was the most accurate model for predicting Women’s Empowerment Group. For a new data example, the model predicted the group as "High."
