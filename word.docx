Title: Women's Empowerment and Gender Parity Analysis Project

Introduction:  
This project aims to analyze the global Women's Empowerment Index (WEI) and the Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI) using country-specific data. The dataset includes metrics like Human Development Group and Sustainable Development Goal regions, and the analysis compares multiple models for predicting empowerment levels.

Dataset:  
The dataset is sourced from [Women’s Empowerment Index CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamneyho/Assignment-1/refs/heads/main/women_empowerment_index.csv). Key features include WEI, GGPI, and categories like Women’s Empowerment Group and Gender Parity Group. Necessary preprocessing, such as encoding categorical variables and standardizing numerical data, was applied.

Models:  
Six models were implemented:
1. Logistic Regression (LR)
2. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
4. Decision Tree Classifier (CART)
5. Naive Bayes (NB)
6. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Methodology:  
The dataset was split into features (X) and the target variable (Women’s Empowerment Group), then into training and validation sets. We used K-fold cross-validation (K=10) to evaluate each model, obtaining accuracy scores.

Results:  
The cross-validation results showed SVM as the best-performing model with the highest accuracy. Below is the accuracy comparison for each model:

| Model | Mean Accuracy| Standard Deviation|
|-------|--------------| ------------------|
| LR    | 85.71%       | 2.05%             |
| LDA   | 92.79%       | 5.38%             |
| KNN   | 92.32%       | 3.54%             |
| CART  | 99.00%       | 2.00%             |
| NB    | 93.82%       | 3.98%             |
| SVM   | 96.92%       | 4.11%             |

Visualization:  
The boxplot compares model accuracy scores, demonstrating SVM’s superior performance.

 
Conclusion:  
The SVM model outperformed others in predicting empowerment levels with an accuracy of 96.92%. This project demonstrates that gender and empowerment metrics can be effectively modeled using machine learning, and SVM provides reliable predictions in this context.
