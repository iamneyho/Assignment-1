 Title:  Women's Empowerment and Gender Parity Analysis Project

 Introduction: 
Describe the objective of the project, which is to analyze the Womenâ€™s Empowerment Index (WEI), Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI), and other gender-related metrics across countries to identify patterns in women's empowerment globally. Mention the dataset source and any preprocessing required.

 Data Analysis: 
- Outline key preprocessing steps, such as encoding categorical features (like "Women's Empowerment Group") and standardizing numeric data.
- Describe the features (columns) in the dataset and the machine learning models used, such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines.

 Model Evaluation: 
- Summarize the model comparison through K-fold cross-validation results. Include the boxplot of model accuracies and highlight the best-performing model.

 Results and Discussion: 
- Briefly discuss the performance of each model and the accuracy scores obtained.
- Mention the best model and interpret its accuracy in the context of predicting gender empowerment levels.

 Prediction Example: 
Include an example prediction on new data, if relevant. Describe the new data values and how the best model predicts gender empowerment.

 Conclusion: 
Summarize findings, insights, and potential future improvements.
